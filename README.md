# deloitte_technology_consulting_virtual_experience_program
The Deloitte Technology Consulting Virtual Internship was probably the hardest program I've done so far, but it was also the most exciting. 
I picked this program because of "name-power", signalling in effect. I had no idea what I signed up for. The actual experience has 3 modules: Technology Strategy and Innovation, Optimisation and Delivery, and Cloud Engineering. Each of these modules had three tasks, and each task was wayyy out of my comfort zone. I like to think I did admirably though.
