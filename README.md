# accenture_project_management_virtual_experience
If there's a common theme with all my virtual internships (so far), it's start I start out knowing very little about the field of study, but very curious to learn more. 
I've been interested in project management (and product management too, but they're unrelated in this context) for a year now, and I felt this was an optimal way to learn more.
Accenture describes the internship, which they call "Keeping Track" as capturing "essentials that are paramount to project management (PM) roles. This course highlights the benefits of various PM methodologies and will teach you characteristics of an effective project manager."
