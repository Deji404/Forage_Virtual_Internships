# kpmg_data_analysis_virtual_experience_program
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Experience is a program designed to help interested people gain a practical insight into the work done at KPMG and build their career skills and experience.
I started this program in early 2021 as an introduction to Data Analytics. I'd always been interested in that space, but I had no time and opportunity to explore my interests, but fortunately this internship provided that chance.
I completed the internship somewhat late (I overestimated my abilities and underestimated the difficulty of the program), but I enjoyed every task. 
Uploading to GitHub is a way to document my progress and keep the potential to revisit my work later. If anyone finds this, I hope it's useful to them.
